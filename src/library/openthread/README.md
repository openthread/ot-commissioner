# OpenThread Common

This directory includes source files from the OpenThread (https://github.com/openthread/openthread) project. They defines common utilities for Thread Commissioning. Current OpenThread project doesn't compile a separate library to make this reusable. A `TODO` is to make OpenThread produce this common library and remove the copies here.
