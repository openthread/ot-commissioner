Example usage of sending MLR.req with OT-commissioner.

Topology
The topology is simple that only a leader/PBBR is started
and connected as "/dev/ttyUSB0" (hosted by a raspberry pi).
The commissioner server resides on the same raspberry pi
and connect to the Thread network through local border agent.

Send MLR.req
The OTCommissioner instance acts as an client of the commissioner
server and requests the commissioner to send a MLR.req message
by calling `MLR(multicastAddrs, timeout)`. The whole process failed
if there are exceptions throwed, otherwise, we succeed sending
MLR.req (MLR.rsp verified as status=ST_MLR_SUCCESS).
