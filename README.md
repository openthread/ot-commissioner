# OpenThread Commissioner

Per the Thread 1.2.0 Specification, a Thread Commissioner connects to and manages a Thread network. A Thread network requires a Commissioner to commission new Joiner devices. A Thread Commissioner minimally supports the following functions:

- Connecting to a Thread network through a Thread Border Agent
- Steering and commissioning new devices
- Get/set Thread network datasets

OpenThread's implementation of a Thread Commissioner is called OpenThread Commissioner (OT Commissioner).

OT Commissioner features include:

- Implements both the Thread 1.1 and 1.2 Commissioner (with Commercial Extension)
- Cross-platform (Linux, Mac OS, Android) Commissioner library
- Interactive Commissioner CLI Tool (Linux, Mac OS)
